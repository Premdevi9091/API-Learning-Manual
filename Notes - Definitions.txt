HTTP -> HyperText Transfer Protocol is a communticating protocol that use for transferring 
data between client & servers over the web.

HTTP methods -> HTTP methods are the operations performed on resources(data) such as creating, 
retrieving, updating and deletion.

PUT/PATCH -> Put update the entired data where as PATCH only update the specific data.

HTTP Status Code -> indicates the result of an API such as success or fail.

HTTP Headers -> HTTP headers contain metadata about the request or response, 
such as content type, authentication details, and caching rules.

REQUEST/RESPONSE HEADER
Request headers send information from client to server
Response headers send information from server to client

Content-Type header -> format of the request/response body such as application/json

Accept header -> It tells the server which response format the client expects

CRUD Operations -> CRUD operation represent the complete life cycle of data manuplication 
of API using HTTP methods.
C   Create  POST        201 Created
R   Read    GET         200 OK
U   Update  PUT/PATCH   200 OK
D   Delete  Delete      200 OK/ 204 No Content  

Idempotent -> Performing same operations multiples times produce the same result.
(i.e Repeating the request does not change the final state of the server.)

HTTP        Method	            Idempotent?	Reason
GET	        ✅ Yes	            Only reads data
PUT	        ✅ Yes	            Replaces resource completely
PATCH	    ❌ Usually No	    Partial update may change state
DELETE	    ✅ Yes	            Resource remains deleted
POST	    ❌ No	            Creates new resource each time

Parameters -> are the values send by client to servers for
    identify resource
    filter data
    customize response
Types: 
Path Parameters     -> are part of URL to identify specific resoruce         /products/2
Query Parameters    -> are used to filter, pignation, sort, search data      /products?q=xyz
Body Parameters     -> JSON in Request Body
Header Parameters   -> Header in request Authorization

Query Parameters
Type            Purpose                                   example                         
search          find data based on keyword                products/search?q=text
limit           how many data be to return                products?limit=5  
skip            skip records and return next data         products?skip=1  

Scripts -> where user defined the test.
Types:  
Pre-request -> It is executed before the request and is used for setup tasks like generating tokens or timestamps.
worked at collection, folder and request level function
Post-response -> It is executed after the request and is used for setup variables from response
worked at collection, folder and request level function as post validation

Variables -> Variables store dynamic values that can be reused across requests.

Type            Purpose                         via Script
Global          Available everywhere            pm.globals.set("name", "value")
Environment     Environment-specific            pm.environments.set("name", "value")
Collection      Collection-only                 pm.collectionVariables.set("name","value")
Local           Request-only                    pm.variables.set("name","value")

Variables Precedence -> Local > Environment > Collection > Global > Data

Environment -> Environments allow us to manage environment-specific variables like base URL, tokens, 
and credentials for QA, staging, and production. To avoid hardcoding values and easily switch between 
environments without changing requests.

Data -> where we use csv file to provides data while running the collection.

API chaining -> using data of one API response(like token, id) in another API request.

Collection Runner -> Collection Runner allows execution of multiple API requests sequentially 
like an automated test suite.

Authentication -> Authentication is the process of verifying who you are.
Types:

1. No Auth -> No authentication is required, we can access request without any auth.
2. API Key -> Required API key to access the request
3. Bearer token -> Token is used as authentication to access the request
4. Basic auth -> Username + password is used as authentication, not encrypted
5. Digest auth -> Username + password is used as authentication and encrypted
6. Outh 1.0 -> Used 3th party auth tool
7. Outh 2.0 -> Used 3th party auth tool
